# Amazon_EDA
# What  it is:

This is a portfolio project done under atomcamp's bootcamp on a custom dataset scapped by the said organization from a popular e-commerce site.

# How it is done:

The project is an EDA project undertaken in the Python language and it utlize python essential data analytics and visualization libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Methodology:

The project is largely divided into multiple sections like:
Data Clearning,
Univariate Analysis,
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis,
Hypothesis Testing, and
Advanced Analytics like Cohort Analysis, Customer Segmentation, Price Elasticity Estimation, Anamoly Detection and much more

# Key Findings:

Since the project utilizes a dataset for multiple clothing brands of all categories for the US market, there is no single observation there. Instead, there are multiple obervarions for each different category, region, customer_age_group and brand. For instance, we found out that Nike sold exponentially higher amount of products than the following top three combined. We also found out that while customers from the age grop of 55+ tend to shop the most on platform, it is however the customers from the age group of 18 - 24 that drove the most revenue. The return rate was almost even across all the  different categories, regions and payment_method types. Morever, we found out one of the most bizzare thing that late delivery did not really meant more returns. Instead, we found out that  products that were shipped either on first day of order placement or the fifth day of order placement tend to get returned more than those shipped on the eigth or ninth day. Similarly, we found out that most customers tend to purchase two items in a single order.

# Instructions to reproduce:

The only instruction to reproduce this same analysis is to spend a good amount of time denoising and decluttering this messy dataset. There are  alot of missing values: impute them,there are alot of inconsistencies: deal with them and there is no observable pattern for customer purchase behaviour so try and avoid customer purchase behabious analysis.
